This is a OOTM to help with simple debugging with the PMT messages.

Primary focus has been looking at uint8_t vectors and meta data.

:::For the message source text file (this is only passing the vector):::
FORMAT SPECS:

(hex byte(2 text characters ex: 0f))(space)(hex byte(2 text))(space)(...repeat)(\n - end of message)
(hex byte(2 text characters ex: c9))(space)(hex byte(2 text))(space)(...repeat)(\n - end of message)
